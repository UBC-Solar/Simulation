# Route File Guidelines

In order to facilitate the use of simple and efficient 
algorithms, many assumptions about the nature of 
the route have been baked into their design. 
Thus, it is imperative that the user follows these guidelines
to maintain the assumptions that the algorithms will make.

1. The KML file has been automatically generated by Google Earth.
2. The KML file contains exactly one polygon.
3. The polygon is closed.
4. The polygon contains coordinates of even and close spacing (~10-20m).
5. Optionally, the user may, to a small and conservative degree, vary the spacing to control the angle between coordinates (affecting the Simulation's interpretation of the degree of curvature along the route).
